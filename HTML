            <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>My name is Daisy Zhao and I live in Los Angeles, California.</p>
      <p>I have lived in Los Angeles all my life, but I travel across the United States frequently due to the nature of my job. </p>

   <article id="About-Me" >
            <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am currently working as a consultant for hospitals. However, as I get older, the travel life is no longer for me. I decided to join Thinkful's Engineering Flex program in order to expand my skillset and find a new career path. I wouldn't say coding is necessarily my passion, but I do believe it is the future. I love working amongst a team and sharing ideas. I believe that when you are working amongst a team, that is when you can learn the most. I am open to constructive criticism if it means I can better my coding skills. If there is something I do not understand, I will not stop until I am able to figure it out. </p>
    <p>Although I can be a little uptight with my work ethics, I do like to have fun:
      <ul>
        <li>I like to go to the gym to workout. </li>
        <li>I love trying new foods. </li>
        <li>I like to play video games. </li>
      <ul>
        </p>
